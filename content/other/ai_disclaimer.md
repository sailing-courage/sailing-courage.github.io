Disclaimer: Certain sections of this website were generated with the assistance of ChatGPT, an AI language model developed by OpenAI. However, it is important to note that all autogenerated text has been thoroughly reviewed, edited, and fact-checked for accuracy and reliability by a human editor.

As an example, this disclaimer itself was entirely generated by ChatGPT based on the following prompt: "Write a disclaimer, explaining that parts of a text were generated with ChatGPT by giving it the notes taken while designing an open source navigation system. Note that all autogenerated text was edited and fact-checked. Mention, as an example, that this disclaimer was entirely generated by ChatGPT and quote the full prompt."

Although significant efforts have been made to ensure the content's quality, it is crucial to independently verify the information and consult authoritative sources for specific guidance on navigation systems or related subjects.

OpenAI, the organization behind ChatGPT, assumes no responsibility or liability for the use or interpretation of the information in this text. Users should exercise their own judgment and discretion when relying on the content generated by ChatGPT, understanding that it serves as a tool that requires human oversight and critical evaluation.
