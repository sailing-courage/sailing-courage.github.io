You will need some kind of input device (mouse/pointer/trackpad/touch/keyboard) for your system. There are many options.

Some opt for a touchscreen display. But in my experience, even the good ones suck to use with wet and cold hands. The waterproof ones are also expensive.

If you want a touch option, you can get cheap second-hand rugged tablets. We got a used [Samsung Galaxy Active Tab 2](https://www.samsung.com/es/business/tablets/galaxy-tab-active/galaxy-tab-active2-8-0-t395-sm-t395nzkaphe/) for 80 EUR that we use for all kinds of things onboard. It has been very useful and could potentially serve as a touchscreen for the [Raspberry Pi]{{< ref "what_is_a_raspberry_pi" >}}.

If you go for a non-touch screen, you need some kind of mouse. Commercial ships normally use [trackballs](https://seatronx.com/products/trackballs/marine-trackballs/). But waterproof ones are not widely available. A [waterproof silicone mouse](https://www.wetkeys.com/Ergonomic-Optical-Waterproof-Mouse-Button-Scroll-p/omwk0c01-bk.htm) is a good substitute.

I initially got one with touch zoom scroll. But I changed to one with scroll buttons, because they work better when wet.
